## start

You step on faulty stone, you loose your balance and you roll down
a small opening in the floor.

After a tachycardic long second of free fall you land on a pile of old branches and leafs.

## check-info-torches

The light from the torch on the wall flickrs with a strange pattern,
some benevolent force is trying to comunicate with you ...

There are nr. `sum(user["team"]["switches"].values())` open gates.
There are nr. `len(gram["2"]["all_users"])` contestants in the dungeons.
There are nr. `len(gram["2"]["waiting"])` newcomers locked in dark rooms.

## limbo-help-success

The right stone stepped under your feet, the whole floor is shaking.

Part of the wall magically collapse on its onw immovability and a passage opens.

From a remote deep location your hear a familar sound, you are not sure if your heard your own eco
or if that was another voice...

## limbo-push

Nothing happens

## no-way-back-push

The walls are immovable huge blocks of stone, they cannot even be scratched

## no-way-back

The walls are slippery and flat.

There is no way back.

## limbo

You are trapped in a dark room

You cannot tell if your voice is the only one.

Thats is strange.

The code is: `gram["2"]["triples][user["team"]["id"]]["give"]["code"]`
you have to give to the team who is doing this:  `gram["2"]["triples][user["team"]["id"]]["give"]["recv_team_hint"]`
the location is:  `gram["2"]["triples][user["team"]["id"]]["give"]["time_hint"]`

## Final question
From above you have a glimpse of the structure of the maze,
it is enigmatic shape.

You go up further and you see it its entirity, it is a strange prespective.

You are far above it but still inside it, the magic power permeating this siniter location is too powerful.

The only way to defeat your cage is to say it's name
