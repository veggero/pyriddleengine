# Outside

Ok, so.

I actually managed to find the Snake's Shrine and reach it. You can picture it, in theory, as a very little castle on top of hill. There's an internal garden with tall walls all around; and obviously, around it people from all around the world have built their homes, creating a small village.

> ["In theory"?](#broken-castle)

### Broken Castle  

Well... apparently I'm not the only one who's attempting at the Shrine's richness, but going through the daughter is surely a much kinder way compared to what... whoever did this has.

To put it simply, the Shrine is half of the height it should've been. The top half fell on top of the walls, and the main entrance.

> [Oh, so you ARE here for the money](#you-got-me)

> [On the entrance? How convenient!](#inconvenient)

> [We'll find another way in.](#village)

### You got me

You got me there.

> [Sigh. Let's find a way in](#village)

### Inconvenient

How *inconvenient*, you mean. How the hell are we getting in now!?

> [I'll figure out something](#village)

## Village

Yeah. Right now I got in the main streets of the village around the castle. Let me se...

Are we looking for something in particular?

There's the main street... but that one actually seem rather boring, you know, it's where I would expect schools or libraries to be, but it's otherwise quite empty.

I do see a couple of streets that do seem full of markets and stalls... looks more interesting.

From here, I can also see a small square with a church in front of it.

> [Libraries, you said?](#main-street)

> [Markets? Interesting...](#markets)

> [Big fan of churches, actually.](#church)

### Village again

So, we're back to the village entrance. Where should we go now?

> [Go for the main street](#main-street)

> [Markets seem to be useful](#markets)

> [Let's get to the church](#church)

## Church

You Italians surely know how to build pretty churches. This one has an impressive giant glass window in its entrance. But, uh, I'm not quite an expert. What are we looking for here?

Oh, there does seem to be quite a bit of people around here...

> [Actually, let's go back](#village-again)

> [Go talk to them!](#populum)

> [Let's get into the church](#church-inside)

### Church Again

OK, so. We're in front of the church again. What now?

> [Back to the village entrance](#village-again)

> [Let's talk to the people](#populum)

## Church Inside

Erm, you know what? I'm actually... not that big of a fan of that idea. Could we avoid that?

> [Are you... scared?](#scared)

> [Mh, okay](#church-again)

> [No, really, get in](#hell-no)

### Scared

Kind-of. Long story. Let's get back, shall we?

> [Long story? I've got time](#ehm-nah)

> [Get in, stop complaining](#hell-no)

> [Fine](#church-again)

### Ehm Nah

Honestly, we don't have that much time. And I really don't like how you are trying to invade my personal space. I'm not under your direct control. Please.

> [Sorry, you're right](#church-again)

> [No, really, get in there now](#hell-no)

### Hell No

Okay, listen to me: NO. I'm NOT doing that. Let's immediately set some clear boundaries between us. I'm not your toy. I'm me, with my own personality, goals and beliefs. If you don't agree, maybe we should stop now.

> [Sorry, you're right](#church-again)

> [You're overreacting](#bye)

### bye

Bye.

> [Bye.](#bye)

> [Ok, ok, I'm sorry!](#sorry)

### Sorry

Mh. But please, don't do that again. Ever. Let's get back to where we were.

> [Right.](#church-again)

## Populum

There's lots of people actually... Oh, wait, they're talking about the Shrine!

> [Isn't it a castle?](#not-now)

> [What are they saying?](#listen)

### Not Now

Look, I understand that the fact that the castle is called Shrine is confusing, but this seems like the worst timing ever to ask about it!!

> [Right. Sorry.](#listen)

### Listen

They're talking about... Three Games... to get in... Apparently, there IS a way to get in, the entrance is not actually blocked... but you have to solve an enigma.

And even if you get inside... it's not easy to actually get in the castle itself, because the entrance will only bring you to the internal garden, not inside of the castle... there's apparently a secret way to get in...

And even if you get inside of the castle... there's a Third Enigma to solve if you want to even talk to the king... oh my, this sounds so complex...

> [Ask about the First Enigma](#first)

> [Ask about the Second Enigma](#second)

> [Ask about the Third Enigma](#third)

### First

Hey! HEY! 

What's that first enigma you were talking about?

HEY! Yes, the first one!

...

They said something... I think it's in italian...

I don't understand... It's something about a game... a very easy one... for children...

oh, but there's apparently a much harder version

Yeah, it's somehow related to that...

> [That's it?](#populum-end)

### Second

Hey! HEY!

What's that second enigma you were talking about?

HEY! Yes, the second one!

...

They said something... I didn't quite get it...

It's about... some tunnels... a water-system, maybe?

And doors... this should be solved by two people together, they said...

> [That's it?](#populum-end)

### Third

Hey! HEY!

What's that third enigma you were talking about?

HEY! Yes, the third one!

...

Oh, apparently they are not sure what's the third one.

It's similar to... uh, something about green, yellow and gray letters?

> [That's it?](#populum-end)

### Populum End

Ehm, yeah. They don't... seem particularly willing to give out more informations, if you know what I mean.

Maybe if I try again... later on...

Anyway, where were we?

> [The church.](#church-again)

## Markets

Okay, so. Markets. Lots of people around, tablet, they're selling all sort of stuff. Not that I actually see anything useful, apparently.

There are some doors that seem to advertise useful stuff, I don't know, food and similar stuff. But again, what are we looking for?

> [Uh, I don't know!](#come-on)

> [Check out those tables maybe](#tables)

> [Maybe those doors you talked about?](#doors)

> [Let's get back to the village entrance](#village-again)

### Come On

Oh, come on. You said you were going to figure out something.

> [Right. Let me try again](#markets)

### Tables

Okay, so...

There's this guy that plays... some weird game with pieces shaped as knights, it seems.

One guy advertises love potions. Suuure. They'll sure work amazingly well.

Another weird guy playing a game. Crosses and circles, it seems. Seems complex.

Oh, that one is also selling... short swords! Oh, finally something useful.

> [Pieces shaped as knights?](#chess)

> [Love potions?](#love-potions)

> [Crosses and circles?](#tictactoe)

> [Short swords?](#short-swords)

> [Let's get back to the markets](#markets)

### Chess

Uh... a weird game indeed. I'm not sure I want to play. Probably, I wouldn't know how to play it.

He does have a sign that explains how to play with him, apparently.

> [Naah, forget that](#tables)

> [What does it say?](#chess-link)

### Chess Link

It says... "lichess org"? what does that even mean? and there's some weird symbol that looks like a circle? and then "niccolove"... is that an italian word? A name?

> [Uh, I have no clue.](#tables)

### Love Potions

OH, come on, I'm not ACTUALLY buying anything like that. It's not like they actually work, ahah.

> [Ehm, right, sure](#tables)

### TicTacToe

I really don't understand how I'm supposed to play. Anybody can pay a little prize here and do a match with the guy, and I'm watching these two play, but I have no clue whatsoever. It's like... a grid of grids? with crosses and circles. I'm confused. There's a sign, though.

> [What does it say?](#tictactoe-sign)

> [Naah, forget about it](#tables)

### TicTacToe Sign

Uhh... it says, "to beat me, come at HERE". I think it's meant for you, actually, not me.

Oh, HERE has a picture drawn underneath it. It says, "red arrow on the bottom".

> [Oh. I'll look into it](#tables)

### Short Swords

Ooh, this is lovely. There are various kinds. Short and portable, but also longer (more effective!) but less easy to carry around. They're quite cheap too! I can afford them.

> [Nah, not a good idea](#tables)

> [Go for the short one!](#ops)

> [Go for the longer one!](#ops)

### Ops

...

...

...

Ehm, looks like there was a misunderstanding.

I can only buy these with a written authorization. It's not like everyone can just... buy them.

That'd be dangerous, he said.

> [Oh.](#tables)

### Doors

Oh, I was just going to enter, but I just saw this sign...

"Closed due to lack of time of the writer! So lazy. The solution is elsewhere!"

What does that even mean?

> [...sigh. Go back](#markets)

## Main Street

Oh, this is actually the street that brings to the main entrance!

I can see the castle entrance from here! Looks like it's going to be easier than I though.

> [Go for the castle!](#castle)

> [Nah, go back to village entrance](#village-again)

### Main Street Again

Main street again.

> [Go to the castle entrance](#castle)

> [Go to the village entrance](#village-again)

### Castle

I'm in front of the entrance.

There's... a guard that won't let me in.

He asks for a password that, he says, will assure him that I'm... "smart enough to survive in there"? What would that mean!?

> [Go back](#main-street-again)

> [Ask him to elaborate!](#elaborate)

### Elaborate

...

Ok, he says: I'm bored, so I might actually let you in. But to do that,

well, I have to prove my intelligence or something. He seem to have a very clear idea of what he expected from me, it seemed like he wants a particular password or passphrase.

I don't know, how can I (or you) show off our my (or yours) intelligence? And receive in exchange a passphrase?

> [No idea, dude](#castle)

> [Oh, I think I know the phrase](#try)

### Try

Oh, really? Please, then! Go for it!

> `"#wrong" if message.lower().strip() != "the show must go on" else "#correct"`

### Wrong

The guard looked at me like I said some gibberish... which I probably did. Sigh.

> [Nevermind that, then.](#castle)

### Correct

Oh, he's actually rather impressed that I knew the right words and he decided to let me in.

> [I KNEW IT! Yeah!](pairing.md#inside)
