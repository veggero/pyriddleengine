# Castle

Ok.

Here we are.

Inside the castle.

> [Finally!! What do you see?](#talk)

## Talk

Before that, we need to talk.

> [Again!?](#talk-2)

> [This is the worst timing...](#talk-2)

> [Sure](#talk-2)

### Talk 2

Listen up. I'm sure you think that I'm just here for the money, the fame, and the richness.

> [Well, yeah](#talk-3)

> [Who wouldn't be?](#talk-3)

> [You basically admitted it!](#talk-3)

### Talk 3

Sure, sure. But hear me out. I'm not. I actually don't care.

> [I find that hard to believe](#talk-4)

> [Oh, come on, what else?](#talk-4)

> [Wait... you're actually in love?](#talk-5)

### Talk 4

I'm *actually* in love.

> [Nooo...](#talk-5)

### Talk 5

Yes, in love. That girl... I actually know her very well. Not that I've ever spoken to her, to be clear.

But I've seen her. And she saw me. And she spoke to me.

Years ago, I was living in a village very, very far in the north.

However, said village was still withing the area of influence of the King of the Snake Shrine.

He never, ever came to us, and I had never seen his castle.

But we very much knew we were his slaves, and he knew he had to keep up happy.

We never saw him, but he sent his daughter to us.

She was kind and welcoming.

Not that she ever talked to the people of the city as a whole, but she did visit the house of the most influent people of the village.

Luckly for me, back then, I was actually serving food at formal dinners. A boy I was.

I only have one memory of that. I keep that memory close to me, to my body, every time I sleep, or watch the Void, in thought.

I was holding wine, and she had her cup empty.

I refilled her cup, and whilst I was doing that, she turned to me, smiled.

She raised her hand and touched mine to stop me. She kindly straighten the wine pitcher.

I only then realized that I was so focused on her that I had spilled wine outside of her glass.

Ashamed, I tried to grab some silk to clean up, but again she stopped me.

And, with kindness, she only said: «It's fine».

Needless to say, I never saw her again, nor have I ever held a wine pitcher since then.

And now I'm here, and she's just a couple of rooms above me.

Let's do this.

> [Let's do this](#castle-main)

> [WAIT WAIT WAIT. THAT WAS...](#that-was)

### That was

...that was?

> [Deep](#deep)

> [Cringe](#cringe)

> [Exciting!](#exciting)

> [Way too long](#long)

### Deep

She surely has a deep meaning to me. I'm doing all of this for her. But honestly, I was quite afraid to actually open up about this.

> [It's fine. Let's do it](#castle-main)

> [Yeah but... cringe.](#cringe)

> [Exciting!](#exciting)

### Cringe

Is it cringe to love?

Is it cringe to spend a childhood barely being able to see anything that's two streets away from your birthplace?

Is it cringe to spend a childhood without ever seeing any person of the opposite sex, not ever your mother?

Is it cringe to finally meet HER? Her, the first girl to see me. See me through. I messed up, I spilled wine. And she was kind to me, something I cannot say even of my own mother.

> [Sorry.](#nevermind)

### Exciting

Yeah! Let's do this. Let's go get her!

> [Ehm, yeah!](#castle-main)

### Long

Sometimes, things have to be said. Sometimes, thruth shall be spoken.

> [Yeah. Let's do this!](#castle-main)

> [Yeah but... cringe.](#cringe)

### Nevermind

Yeah, yeah.

Honestly, I'm not even sure I should continue talking to you.

> [Let's do this together](#castle-main)

> [Our journey should probably end here](#the-end)

### The end

You're right. It's been a pleasure. Hopefully, you'll find somebody else to have an exciting experience with.

> [NO WAIT I WAS KIDDING!](#castle-main)

> [It's been a great journey. So long!](main.md#introduzione-personaggio)
